<p class="intro">Tired from the fast moving life of the present Hercules thinks of how it would be living the life with the current technology but in ancient times. Say maybe 250 years.
He learns that time travel is possible. Hard work for a decade and there it is. With the bright minds of the world and his research papers he has built its very own 
"Time Machine". Test runs are scheduled and all of the people are excited. 
Help. Help. No. How. Someone. 
Hercules is inside the machine and someone has switched on the machine. The time set is 25 August 1765. He wanted to be on the same date and experience the ancient life. This was his sole purpose of making the machine.
Thankfully he reaches in one piece but the thought of getting back to its present world haunts him down. There is one thing that gives him some hope. His research papers. They are with him.
Live the "Flashhback!" with Hercules and help him come back to its present world!

Team - Flashhback!
