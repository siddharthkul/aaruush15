<p class="intro">When you are in a room, alone, you feel something walk past you. Is it a sensation that you should worry about, or just an illusion that made you fear?
Since ages have men feared the unknown called &#39;Ghosts&#39; and undermined the &#39;Minions&#39;. Feel the terror as the minions become ghosts, and haunt you throughout the event.  Beware and do not run, for if you fear, you lose it here.
