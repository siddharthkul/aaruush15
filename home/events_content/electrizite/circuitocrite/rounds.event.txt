<ul>
<li>	In this round the team will be initially provided with an answer sheet where they have to answer 8 questions.</li>
<li>	Then a small breadboard which consists of 4 LED&#39;s and a lot of wired connections will be provided with each row of the breadboard number which will have a mistake.</li>
