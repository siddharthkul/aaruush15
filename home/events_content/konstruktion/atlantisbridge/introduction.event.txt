<p class="intro">A recent study has revealed that the two long neglected near-by islands Palmgrove and Palmcourt are now growing fast by producing high quality of palm, which needs to be marketed. For this purpose, they need to be linked to each other and be easily accessible to the nearby labour to avail the water transport facility. Construction of a vertical lift bridge is proposed to facilitate the efficient movement of ships and cars thus to improve connectivity.
