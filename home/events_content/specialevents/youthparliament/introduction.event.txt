<p class="intro">Welcome everyone,

It is with immense pride that we welcome you all to the second edition of AARUUSH Youth 

Parliament.  Being a part of one of the country&#39;s largest Techno Management Fests, is 

humbling and yet, enormous responsibility.<br>

We expect you to step into the shoes of an Indian Member of Parliament and try your hand 

at guiding the country through troubling times. This conference will be simulating a fictitious 

agriculture crisis in the near future.<br>

Together with the rest of the team at AARUUSH &#39;15, we promise to try our best to host the 

same levels of debate, challenge all participants to come up with nothing short of their very 

best in a conducive environment and all in all, provide an experience to cherish for a long 

time.<br>

Come, be a part of history in the making. Come, be a part of AARUUSH Youth Parliament 

2015.<br> 

Regards,<br>

Organizing Team</p>
