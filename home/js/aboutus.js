And that&#39s what it was, at the time of its inception back in 2007, the rays of the sun, which would eventually enlighten the lives of many people for years to come. Started by four visionary final year students of the college, Aaruush was initially intended to be a technical fest; consisting of 26 events and over 3000 participants, but it has exceeded the expectations of all. And so successful was the idea, that the inauguration was presided over by the former president of India, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.</p> <p>\"Seek and you shall find, when you feel everything is lost, innovation will guide you through\" his words stillecho in the minds of many and has taken Aaruush to the position where it stands now. After its noteworthy beginning in 2007, there was no looking back, it only kept getting better each year. The following year saw Aaruush go national, with over 4500 participants from over 24 states. It was in 2009 that Aaruush evolved from merely a technical fest, to a Techno-Management extravaganza, as we included two new domains \- Fundaz and Online. The reputation of Aaruush kept growing, having tie ups with organizations like European Southern Observatory, IEEE, European Space Agency, and had DRDO unveil its latest technology in the form of the 'Arjun' tank. Reputed NGO's like PETA, HOPE, CRY associated with Aaruush, reflect its social responsibility. And it only got better, Aaruush 2012 and 2013 hosted several stalwarts of repute such as Dr. Richard Matthew Stallman, Mr. Rajan Anandan, Dr. Tessy Thomas, Mr. Aakash Sinha, all sharing their knowledge with the participants.  Aaruush 2014 saw us welcome eminent personalities such as Dr. Krishnaswamy Kasturirangan, Anuraag Batra, Dr. Eshwar Natarajan and also welcomed Mr. Sam Pitroda, all the way from America, with the help of state of the art video conferencing technology.</p><p> Aaruush that year, witnessed an unprecedented footfall, crossing 37000 and set another record, being the platform where the new Arjun Mk II tank was first unraveled. And for those who thought a Techno-Management fest was only about education, Aaruushproved that it was way more, by conducting light and sound shows, Pro shows and the famous Aaruush Nites that attracted the masses by the thousands. The various expos that took place, including the coins expo, the newspaper expo, the Indian Army Weapons Expo and the Auto Expo were prime attractions as the 8th edition of the fest came to a grand end.</p>");
